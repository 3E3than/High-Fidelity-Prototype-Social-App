## Using the Over Drinks Web App High-Fidelity Prototype ##
###########################################################
To Deploy the prototype:
  Locally - clone the repository or download the respository as a .zip file and extract it on your local device. 
  To begin at the login page, launch LoginScreen2.html and follow the on-screen instructions to create a dummy account, 
  which will allow you to navigate the user interface, select bars to choose from, and check matches as the prototype mimics 
  a typical user experience with the app.

  Web-Based - Due the usage of the insecure localStorage API, it is NOT recommended to provide real information when email, 
  username, or password are prompted from the user. If you wish to deploy this prototype in a web-based application, the
  repository can be cloned or downloaded as a .zip file, then the over-drinks folder can be uploaded to your website. To ensure
  normal flow of the application, make sure the user starts at LoginScreen2.html. 

  For optimal Functionality, please use the latest version of browsers that are currently being actively updated, like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, Safari, etc. 
  In addition, ensure that you have internet access while the app is being run so the Bootsrap dependencies, as well as the LLM backend remain functional and 
  do not break app appearance and function.
